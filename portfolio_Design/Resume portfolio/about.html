				<b>Japanese animation, also known as anime (pronounced "ani-may"), 
			           is a popular form of animation in Japan which is quickly spreading 
			           in the U.S.  The major difference between anime and American cartoons
			           is that unlike American cartoons, which are only watched by children, 
			           anime is popular among the Japanese adults and is watched by millions.
			           The audience is not merely directed to children but to teens and adults
			           as well.  The same applies to Japanese comics known as manga.
	                           According to <em>Marwah Zagzoug</em>, who wrote an article about the 
	                           history of anime and manga, World War II was the time when 
			           Japanese art and animation had a significant influence and 
			           impact on the U.S.</b>
