	<h1 class = def> What is Manga?</h1>
	<p class = word>The word "manga" comes from the Japanese word ,
		[20] composed of the two kanji (man) meaning "whimsical or impromptu" and (ga) meaning pictures.
		In Japanese, "manga" refers to all kinds of cartooning, comics, and animation. Among English speakers,
		 "manga" has the stricter meaning of "Japanese comics", in parallel to the usage of "anime" in and outside Japan.
		 The term "ani-manga" is used to describe comics produced from animation cels.</p>

	<h1 class = def1>What is Anime?</h1>
	<p class = Anm>In Japanese, the term anime refers to all forms of animation from around the world.
		       In English, anime is more restrictively used to denote a "Japanese-style animated 
		       film or television entertainment" or as "a style of animation created in Japan".
		       The characteristic anime art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of <em>Osamu
		       Tezuka</em> and spread internationally in the late twentieth century, developing a 
		       large domestic and international audience.</p>

	<h1 class = difference> Difference between Japanese Anime and Cartoon.</h1>
	<p class = exp> Many people are unaware of what is Japanese anime. They even 
			think that anime are some form of cartoons which chidren watch on television 
			such as <strong>Walt Disney</strong> cartoons. Though I am a big fan of <strong>
			Walt Disney</strong> creations which gives me inspiration too. But <b>Anime</b> 
			is far different from the normal cartoons. Japanese Anime is made with a different 
			concept that are watched even by adults such as Naruto, The seven deadly sins.</p>
